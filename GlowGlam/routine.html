            Morning Routine: In the morning, start by cleansing your face with a
            very mild, fragrance-free hydrating cleanser that doesn't strip your
            skin's natural barrier. Follow this with a soothing toner or facial
            mist that’s alcohol-free—look for calming ingredients like chamomile
            or aloe vera. Apply a lightweight moisturizer with ingredients like
            ceramides or hyaluronic acid to maintain hydration and strengthen
            the skin barrier. Finish with a broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 30
            or higher that’s specifically formulated for sensitive
            skin—preferably mineral-based with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide,
            which are less likely to cause irritation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Night Routine: At night, remove any makeup or sunscreen with a
            gentle, oil-based cleansing balm or micellar water designed for
            sensitive skin. Follow up with the same mild cleanser used in the
            morning to ensure your skin is clean without over-washing. Apply a
            calming and nourishing night cream or facial oil with ingredients
            like squalane, calendula, or oat extract to soothe irritation and
            support overnight healing. Lastly, use a hypoallergenic lip balm to
            keep your lips soft and protected through the night. Avoid harsh
            treatments, exfoliants, or fragrances, as sensitive skin reacts best
            to minimal, gentle care.

            Morning Routine: In the morning, start by cleansing your face with a
            gentle hydrating cleanser to remove any impurities that may have
            built up overnight. Follow it up with a hydrating toner or mist to
            refresh and prep your skin. Next, apply a thick moisturizer enriched
            with hyaluronic acid to lock in moisture and keep your skin plump
            throughout the day. Finish your routine with a broad-spectrum
            moisturizing sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher to protect your skin from
            harmful UV rays.
          </p>
          <p>
            Night Routine: At night, begin by removing any makeup and sunscreen
            residue with a cleansing balm, ensuring your skin is clean without
            stripping its natural oils. Then, use a cream-based cleanser to
            further cleanse and soothe your skin. Apply a nourishing night cream
            or a facial oil to help repair and hydrate your skin while you
            sleep. Don’t forget to apply a lip balm to keep your lips soft and
            moisturized overnight.

            Night Routine: At night, begin by removing makeup and any leftover
            sunscreen with a gentle cleansing balm that melts away impurities
            without over-drying your skin. Follow up with a cream-based cleanser
            to ensure a thorough yet soothing cleanse. Then, apply a nourishing
            night cream or a light facial oil to help your skin recover and stay
            hydrated while you sleep. Lastly, use a lip balm to keep your lips
            soft and moisturized overnight, ensuring they stay smooth and
            comfortable.

            Morning Routine: In the morning, cleanse your face with a gentle
            foaming or gel-based cleanser that helps remove excess oil and keeps
            your skin feeling fresh without stripping away natural moisture.
            Follow this with a lightweight, alcohol-free toner or facial mist to
            balance your skin’s pH and control shine. Apply an oil-free,
            water-based moisturizer that contains hyaluronic acid to hydrate
            without clogging pores. Finish your morning routine with a
            broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher—preferably a matte or
            gel-based formula—to protect your skin from sun damage while keeping
            it shine-free.
          </p>
          <p>
            Night Routine: At night, start by removing makeup and excess oil
            with a cleansing balm or micellar water that’s suitable for oily
            skin. Follow up with a gentle gel or foaming cleanser to ensure your
            pores are thoroughly cleansed. After cleansing, apply a lightweight,
            non-comedogenic night gel or serum that contains ingredients like
            niacinamide or salicylic acid to help balance oil production and
            support overnight skin repair. End your routine with a simple lip
            balm to keep your lips moisturized and smooth through the night.

            Morning Routine: In the morning, cleanse your face with a gentle,
            balancing cleanser that effectively removes excess oil from the
            T-zone without drying out the cheeks. After cleansing, apply a
            refreshing toner or facial mist to even out skin tone and prep your
            face for hydration. Use a lightweight moisturizer that hydrates dry
            areas while being non-greasy enough for oil-prone zones—look for
            ingredients like hyaluronic acid or glycerin. Finish your routine
            with a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher, ideally a
            formula that’s hydrating yet non-comedogenic, to protect your skin
            without clogging pores or causing shine.
          </p>

            Night Routine: At night, begin by removing any makeup and buildup
            with a mild cleansing balm or micellar water. Follow this with a
            gentle cream or gel-based cleanser that addresses both dry and oily
            areas. Apply a nourishing night cream or serum that offers hydration
            without being too rich—this helps repair and balance the skin
            overnight. If your skin feels dry in some spots, you can layer a bit
            more moisturizer there. Don’t forget to apply a lip balm before bed
            to keep your lips soft and moisturized.
