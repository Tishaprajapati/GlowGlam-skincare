                  Dark skin tone is naturally rich in melanin and beautiful in
                  its depth and glow. However, it may sometimes face concerns
                  like uneven patches, dullness, or hyperpigmentation. At
                  GlowGlam, we offer personalized skincare routines tailored to
                  melanin-rich skin. Our solutions include gentle exfoliation,
                  vitamin C serums, deep hydration, and SPF-based protection to
                  even out skin tone and enhance natural radiance. Explore safe
                  and effective treatments that respect your skin's beauty and
                  bring out its healthiest glow.

                <div class="sol">
                  Tanned skin often results from prolonged sun exposure, causing
                  melanin overproduction. While a natural tan fades over time,
                  uneven skin tone and sun damage can remain. At GlowGlam, we
                  recommend gentle exfoliation, cooling aloe vera-based masks,
                  and vitamin C serums to brighten skin. Regular sunscreen use
                  and hydration help restore your skin’s natural tone and
                  protect against future tanning.

                Blackheads <img src="blackheads.png" id="img3" />
                <div class="sol">
                  Blackheads are tiny, stubborn pores clogged with oil, dead
                  skin, and impurities. They often appear on oily areas like the
                  nose, chin, and cheeks, and can worsen with makeup buildup or
                  improper cleansing. At GlowGlam, we believe in treating
                  blackheads with patience and care. Our solution includes the
                  use of salicylic acid-based cleansers that deeply clean pores,
                  clay masks to absorb excess oil, and non-comedogenic
                  moisturizers to prevent future clogging. Avoid forcefully
                  squeezing blackheads as it can lead to inflammation or
                  scarring. Instead, adopt a weekly skincare routine with steam
                  treatments to open pores, followed by gentle extraction or
                  charcoal-based strips. A balanced routine helps your skin stay
                  clean, smooth, and blackhead-free.

                  Pimples can be painful, persistent, and emotionally
                  frustrating. They arise due to clogged pores, excess oil,
                  bacteria, or hormonal changes. At GlowGlam, we tackle pimples
                  by first identifying your skin type and root causes. For oily
                  skin, we suggest oil-control cleansers, non-comedogenic
                  products, and ingredients like benzoyl peroxide or tea tree
                  oil to kill bacteria. For dry or combination skin, we opt for
                  mild spot treatments that treat acne without stripping away
                  natural oils. Additionally, lifestyle changes like stress
                  reduction, increased water intake, and proper hygiene
                  (changing pillowcases, avoiding touching the face) make a big
                  difference. Remember, consistency is key—pimple treatment
                  takes time, but the right care can restore clear, healthy
                  skin.

                <div class="sol">
                  Pigmentation occurs when melanin is unevenly distributed,
                  causing dark patches, sunspots, or post-acne marks. It can be
                  due to sun exposure, inflammation, hormonal imbalance, or even
                  injuries. At GlowGlam, our targeted pigmentation treatments
                  are designed to gradually lighten affected areas without
                  damaging the surrounding skin. We recommend using ingredients
                  like niacinamide, alpha arbutin, glycolic acid, and retinoids
                  under expert guidance. Regular exfoliation, adequate sun
                  protection, and nighttime repair routines help reduce melanin
                  buildup and improve skin clarity. We also focus on barrier
                  repair—hydrated skin heals better and faster. With a
                  consistent skincare approach, your skin can regain its natural
                  brightness and smooth, even tone.

                <div class="sol">
                  Dark circles are one of the most common beauty concerns,
                  affecting people across all ages and skin types. They can
                  result from genetics, fatigue, dehydration, screen exposure,
                  or even allergies. At GlowGlam, we offer multi-faceted care
                  for under-eye darkness. We begin with identifying your skin's
                  hydration needs and offer eye creams rich in caffeine, vitamin
                  K, and peptides to reduce puffiness and improve blood
                  circulation. We also recommend cold compresses, green tea
                  bags, and almond oil massages to soothe the delicate eye area.
                  Lifestyle changes—adequate sleep, screen breaks, and a
                  nutrient-rich diet—are just as important as skincare. With
                  regular care, your eyes can look brighter, more awake, and
                  refreshed.
